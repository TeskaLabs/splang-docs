# Dedication

This work is dedicated to the memory of my mother, whose belief in me was as steadfast as it was unconditional.
Though the technicalities of a language design were beyond her realm, her unwavering faith in me was the beacon that guided me through.

Her spirit, love, and resilience remain within me, inspiring and driving me forward.
I hope that this language, a fruit of my labor and love, is a testament to her indomitable spirit.

I would also like to extend my sincere gratitude to all the contributors whose dedication and expertise helped shape this project.
Your collaboration has made this creation possible.

Thank you, Mom.
This is for you.
